Fork of the Redstone XML-RPC implementation.

Targeting Java 11 with some modernization.

Progress:
1. switched to Gradle
2. fixed some documentation
3. removal of some legacy unboxing/patterns

The current version is still targeting the older javax.servlet namespace. The plan is to do a release and then work on upgrading to the Jakarta era.
